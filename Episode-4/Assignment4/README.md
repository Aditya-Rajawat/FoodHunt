- Is JSX mandatory for react?

  No, JSX is not mandatory for react. We can also work in react using React.createElement() but for building large scale applications JSX is highly suggested as it     reduces lines of code and allows writing HTML in JS.


- Is ES6 mandatory for react?

  ES6 is the standardization of javascript for making code more readable and more accessible.If we donâ€™t use ES6 in react, there is an alternative to perform. We use   create-react-class instead of ES6.
